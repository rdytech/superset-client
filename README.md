[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/fc7ee4a03e119a5d859472865fc0bdc9a6e46d51b7f5b8cd62.svg)](https://buildkite.com/jobready/superset-client)

The Repo is `superset-client` with the ruby gem named `superset`

All ruby classes are namespaced under `Superset::`

# Installation

## Setup API Credentials

Follow this to [setup your users API creds](https://github.com/rdytech/superset-client/tree/develop/doc/setting_up_personal_api_credentials.md)

Short version is .. copy the `env.sample` to `.env` and add edit values where applicable.  Opening a console with `bin/console` will then auto load the `.env` file.

## Docker Setup

Build, bundle and open a ruby console

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose run --rm app bundle install
docker-compose run --rm app bin/console
```

## Setup Locally ( no docker ) 

Requires Ruby >= 2.6.0 

Bundle install and open a ruby console.

```
bundle install
bin/console
```

## Including in a Ruby app

Add to your Gemfile `gem 'superset'`  
And then execute: `bundle install`  
Or install it yourself as `gem install superset`

## Run specs

Open a bash console inside the app container and run specs.

```
docker-compose run --rm app bash
```

Then run 'bundle exec rspec' from the container.


## Usage

Experiment with the API calls directly by open a pry console using  `bin/console`.

```ruby
Superset::Dashboard::List.call

superset_class_list # helper method to list all classes under Superset::
sshelp              # aliased for superset_class_list
```

## Duplicating Dashboards

The Primary motivation behind this gem was to use the Superset API to duplicate dashboards, charts, datasets across multiple database connections.

Targeted use case was for superset embedded functionality implemented in a application resting on multi tenanted database setup.

See examples in [Duplicate Dashboards](https://github.com/rdytech/superset-client/tree/develop/doc/duplicate_dashboards.md)
